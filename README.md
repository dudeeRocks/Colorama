# Colorama: Sample Project

Colorama is a sample iOS app project complimentary to my articles on the use of diffable data sources in UIKit.

This project showcases the use of diffable data sources with table and collection views alike, as well as implementation of custom views for cells with the help of `UIContentView` type.

## Articles Linked to the Project

Here are the articles for which this sample project was created:

## UIKit VS SwiftUI

In one of my articles that link to this project I claimed that itâ€™s super easy to create tables and collections that animate dynamic data changes in SwiftUI compared to UIKit. To prove that claim I implemented the core of the sample project in SwiftUI as well. Thus this repository is structured in the following way:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ Colorama.xcworkspace
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ColoramaUIKit.xcodeproj
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ColoramaSwiftUI.xcodeproj
```

## App Architecture

Both Colorama projectsâ€”SwiftUI and UIKitâ€”use largely the same architecture:
- Model manages the creation and storage of the colors represented as ColorItem.
- Views are split into:
    - Table/Collection views;
    - Cell views;
    - Shared details view;
    - Shared helper views (such as, empty state).
- The entry point for both apps is the Root view.

## Screens and Navigation 

UIKit version of the app is a bit more expansive than the SwiftUI, with the latter implementation only the core of the UIKit version.

## Use of Extensions

Colorama UIKit relies heavily on extensions to its types to encapsulate different parts of functionality. For example, the list view controller will have its actions and data source methods encapsulated within separate extensions.

This is meant to ensure maintainability and ease of navigation within the project.
